## computer-vision-and-OCR
A repository containing an implementation of facial recognition using computer vision and an implementation of OCR.

This repository contains the code written as part of the final course/project from the Python 3 Programming Specialisation which was presented and curated by the University of Michigan and offered on Coursera. 

## Project Description
Take a ZIP file of provided newspaper images, stories and advertisements and process them to allow one to search through the images looking for the occurrences of keywords and faces. The end result should be a contact sheet of all the faces in the newspaper page that contain the word that is searched for. For example, if one is to search for "pizza" it will return a contact sheet of all of the faces which were located on the newspaper page which mentions "pizza".

Two ZIP files were provided: one large file called ```images.zip``` (~200 MB) and one small file called ```small_img.zip``` that was used for testing. Each image was saved as a PNG image.

## Approach
Three main libraries were used to complete this assignment, namely PIL (Python Imaging Library), Pytesseract (used for OCR) and openCV (computer vision). Functions were built to ensure that small tasks could be completed and tested before pulling the full requirements together.

## Project Results
The output in the notebook matched the expected results that were provided as a guideline to test the code. The assignment was peer-reviewed and received 100%.
